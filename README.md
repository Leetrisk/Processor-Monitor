# Processor-Monitor
Processor Monitor, a Temperature and usage overlay made in c#
built using openhardware lib, I wont pretend that i made most of this code.

Made as a simple replacement for an overlay that shows usage and temeprature of the CPU and GPU, it is within a few degrees or exact as temperature,  if this is causing any issues, feel free to use a professional overlay such as MSI Afterburner or other alternatives

background color can be changed / background can be removed entirely with the config file, you can also have an image but its scuffed.  the source is available for download here, but if u just want the program, get it from releases ->

# NOT TESTED WITH AMD GPU OR INTEL CPU
If there is problems, i wont fix, this project was made as a simple thing for myself, fix using the source or use professional overlay as mentioned above
